Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .\n",

      "Mrs . Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event . She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost . She had such a regard for Mr . Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago . How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield !                                                                                                            0.756453\n",

He dared not stay longer than to see her well ; these several delays left him not another minute to lose ; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to Mrs . Goddard , and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr . Knightley , he set off , with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0.731042\n",

To Emma ' s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr . Knightley ' s , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion . They had all the assistance which Isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and Mrs . Weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light  first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one  well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr . Woodhouse ' s mind . It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other  in another year or two , perhaps  it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0.782315\n",
      "There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane  turning a corner which he could never bear to think of  and in strange hands  a mere common coachman  no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr . John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem  if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel  perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself . But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.780624\n",
      "While he spoke , Emma ' s mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able  and yet without losing a word  to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that Harriet ' s hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own  that Harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself . And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet ' s secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not . It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two  or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not .    0.755806\n",

      "0 Mr . Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit , that in spite of the increasing coldness , he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it , and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage , with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others ; too full of the wonder of his own going , and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold , and too well wrapt up to feel it .\n",
      "1 \" Oh !\n",
      "2 \" Oh no , no !\n",
      "3 Such was Jane Fairfax ' s history .\n",
      "4 \" That has been a good deal the case , my dear ; but not to the degree you mention .\n",
      "5 \" And I am quite serious too , I assure you ,\" replied Mrs . Elton gaily , \" in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us .\"\n",
      "6 \" And here is Mrs . Weston and Mr . Frank Churchill too ! Quite delightful ; so many friends !\"\n",
      "7 \" You may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together ,\" said Jane , \" they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me .\n",
      "8 Harriet , Mr . Elton , and Mr . Knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them ; the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; Mr . Woodhouse ' s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing .\n",
      "9 \" Oh !\n"
