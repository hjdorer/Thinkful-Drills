1. What are the three longest trips on rainy days?
The three longest trips are 1068614 (duration = 62168), 1076000 (duration = 28263) and 1162895 (duration = 24831).

SELECT 
	trips.trip_id,
	trips.duration,
	left(trips.start_date,10) as date,
	weather.events
FROM
	trips
LEFT JOIN weather 
ON weather.date = left(trips.start_date,10)
AND weather.zip = trips.zip_code
WHERE
	events = 'Rain'
GROUP BY
	trips.trip_id,
	trips.duration,
	left(trips.start_date,10),
	weather.events
ORDER BY duration DESC
LIMIT 3;

2. Which station is full most often?
The "Santa Clara at Almaden" status is full most often.

SELECT 
	status.station_id,
	status.docks_available,
	count(*),
	stations.name
FROM
	status
JOIN
	stations
ON
	stations.station_id = status.station_id
WHERE
	status.docks_available = 0
GROUP BY
	status.station_id,
	status.docks_available,
	stations.name
ORDER BY count(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;

------------------

3. Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.
SELECT 
	trips.start_station,
	count(*),
	stations.dockcount
FROM
	trips
JOIN
	stations
ON
	stations.name = trips.start_station
GROUP BY
	trips.start_station,
	stations.dockcount
ORDER BY stations.dockcount DESC

------------------

4. (Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?
The longest trip is trip 1173890 (duration = 85900).

WITH
	weather_pared
AS (
	SELECT 
		date,
		events,
		count(*)
	FROM
		weather
	WHERE
		events = 'Rain'
	GROUP BY
		date,
		events
	)

SELECT 
	trips.trip_id,
	trips.duration,
	left(trips.start_date,10) as date,
	weather_pared.events
FROM
	trips
JOIN
	weather_pared
ON
	weather_pared.date = left(trips.start_date,10)
GROUP BY
	trips.trip_id,
	trips.duration,
	left(trips.start_date,10),
	weather_pared.events
ORDER BY duration DESC
LIMIT 3;
