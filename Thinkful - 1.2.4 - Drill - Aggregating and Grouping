1. What was the hottest day in our data set? Where was that?
The max temperature is 134F (seems impractical), which occurs in the zip 94063

SELECT 
	zip, MAX(maxtemperaturef)
FROM
	weather
GROUP BY
	zip

------------------
2. How many trips started at each station?
 SELECT 
	start_station, count(*)
FROM
	trips
GROUP BY
	start_station
 
------------------
3. What's the shortest trip that happened? 60 (units?)
SELECT  
	trip_id, min(duration)
FROM
	trips
GROUP BY
	trip_id, duration
ORDER BY duration asc

Note: had issues with this one, wouldn't output ONLY rows with minimum duration
------------------
4. What is the average trip duration, by end station?
SELECT 
	end_station, 
	AVG(duration) as dur_ave
FROM
	trips
GROUP BY 1;
